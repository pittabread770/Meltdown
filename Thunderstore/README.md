### Credits
Everything in the mod was created by `pittabread` (that's me!). If you have any questions or problems with the mod, feel free to ping me on the RoR2 Modding Discord server.

And a personal thank you to the Sandswept and Starstorm 2 mods, who served as inspiration for me to get started in the modding scene, and whose code I would use to help get myself unstuck on some of the more gnarly coding tasks.
