## 0.2.0
- Increased Irradiated damage per second to 75%.
	- Decreased Irradiated damage on Nuclear elites by half, to compensate.
- Increased Plutonium Rounds damage to 200%.
- Increased Reactor Vents damage to 150%.
- Added 5% base burn chance to Charcoal.
- Added 5% base irradiating chance to Uranium Fuel Rods, Volatile Thorium Battery and Leaky Reactor Coolant (for 15% total, if you have all 3).
- Volatile Thorium Battery now deals 200% damage in a 12m AoE and applies all irradiated effects to all damaged enemies, rather than a single enemy per stack.

*I plan to revisit the irradiating items in future, so that they bring something more interesting to the table rather than just a 5% proc chance.*
*I'm also planning to do a general pass on the more out-of-pocket items to bring them more in-line with the theme of the mod.*
*Thanks RoR2 Modding discord for the solid feedback on it all so far.*
