## 0.3.0
- Replaced Metal Claws with Thermite-in-a-Can.
	- This is functionally the same item, but replaces the bleed effect with fire.
- Volatile Thorium Battery, Leaky Reactor Coolant and Uranium Fuel Rods all now work with the Red Alert mod, specifically the Desolator survivor's DoT.
	- I make no promises regarding balance.
- Reworked Volatile Thorium Battery to have a chance per tick to deal extra damage in an area and apply Irradiated.
- Buffed Abandonment by reducing the primary skill damage decrease from 50% to 25%.
- Added a visual indicator to nuclear elites to show how far their blast attack can reach, similar to focus crystal/bolstering lantern.

## 0.2.0
- Increased Irradiated damage per second to 75%.
	- Decreased Irradiated damage on Nuclear elites by half, to compensate.
- Increased Plutonium Rounds damage to 200%.
- Increased Reactor Vents damage to 150%.
- Added 5% base burn chance to Charcoal.
- Added 5% base irradiating chance to Uranium Fuel Rods, Volatile Thorium Battery and Leaky Reactor Coolant (for 15% total, if you have all 3).
- Volatile Thorium Battery now deals 200% damage in a 12m AoE and applies all irradiated effects to all damaged enemies, rather than a single enemy per stack.

*I plan to revisit the irradiating items in future, so that they bring something more interesting to the table rather than just a 5% proc chance.*
*I'm also planning to do a general pass on the more out-of-pocket items to bring them more in-line with the theme of the mod.*
*Thanks RoR2 Modding discord for the solid feedback on it all so far.*
